    Commands related to a remote repository:
        git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git
        git push or git push origin main (Both accomplish the same goal in this context)
    Commands related to the workflow:
        git add .
        git commit -m "A message describing what you have done to make this snapshot different"
    Commands related to checking status or log history
        git status
        git log

The basic Git syntax is program | action | destination.

For example,

    git add . is read as git | add | ., where the period represents everything in the current directory;
    git commit -m "message" is read as git | commit -m | "message"; and
    git status is read as git | status | (no destination).
